The DriverPass project involved developing a system for DriverPass, a client who wanted customers to have access to driving lesson information and scheduling appointments online. Although I created various diagrams and charts successfully, I struggled with differentiating functional and non-functional requirements in the business requirements document, which I plan to revisit. To ensure I considered the user's needs, I relied on feedback from the interview and contemporary web application design. As users may not possess the technical expertise to articulate design preferences precisely, interpretation is often necessary. My software design strategy involves swiftly creating prototypes and seeking feedback from users before refining and incorporating features. This approach aims to clarify initial plans, satisfy user requirements, and prevent wasted development time on unsuitable features.
